📘 JavaScript – Introduction & Fundamentals

🗓️ Date: 10th November

🧠 Topics Covered

In today’s session, we began our Introduction to JavaScript, focusing on how the language operates, performs calculations, and controls program flow.

Key Concepts Covered:

JavaScript Basics

What JavaScript is and how it interacts with HTML and the browser.

Data Types

Understanding primitive types like string, number, boolean, undefined, and null.

Operators

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)

Assignment (=, +=, -=)

Comparison (==, ===, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

Logical (&&, ||, !)

Control Structures

if, else if, else

switch

Loops (for, while, do...while)

Math in JavaScript

Using the built-in Math object for calculations.


📘 JavaScript Session – 12 November 2025

🧠 Topics Covered:

In today’s session, we explored Scope, Events, Strings, and Arrays in JavaScript.
The session focused on understanding how JavaScript:

Manages variable visibility and scope (global, local, and block-level)

Handles user interactions through events

Performs string manipulation for dynamic text operations

Works with arrays for storing and processing multiple data values

Uses mathematical operations and built-in functions effectively

💻 Key Learning Outcomes:

Gained clarity on the concept of scope in JavaScript and how it affects variable access.

Implemented event listeners to respond to user actions like clicks and input changes.

Practiced manipulating strings and arrays using built-in JavaScript methods.

Enhanced problem-solving skills by writing practical code examples.

📝 Task for Practice:

> Create a JavaScript program that:

> Takes user input as a string.

> Splits it into an array.

> Displays both the original string and the array result on a webpage.

> Uses events to trigger the display dynamically.


📘 JavaScript Session Summary — 13 November 2025
Topics Covered

In today’s session, we explored important JavaScript ES features and practical DOM-based implementations. The major concepts covered include:

🔹 1. DOM (Document Object Model)

Understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.

Selecting, modifying, creating, and deleting elements dynamically.

Handling DOM properties and methods to change webpage content.

🔹 2. Hoisting

How variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope.

Difference between hoisting behavior of var, let, const, and functions.

🔹 3. Functions

Revisiting normal function declarations and function expressions.

Understanding parameters, return values, and scope behavior inside functions.

🔹 4. Arrow Functions

Introduction to modern ES6 arrow function syntax.

Differences between normal functions and arrow functions (such as this binding).

When to use arrow functions for cleaner code.



🚀 Practical Implementation


✔️ Counter Application (Using DOM)

You built an interactive counter app implementing:

> DOM selectors

> Event listeners

> Increment, decrement, and reset logic

> Real-time UI updates

> This helped clarify how DOM manipulation works in real applications.


✔️ Image Resize Application


> Using DOM properties and event handling, you implemented:

> Increasing and decreasing image size dynamically

> Using buttons and event listeners

> Applying inline styles with JavaScript


📘 JavaScript Session Summary — 18 November 2025
Topics Covered

In today’s session, we explored key concepts in Modern JavaScript, focusing on:

Using extends for inheritance

Differences between ES6 classes and traditional constructor functions

🔹 2. Objects in JavaScript

Creating and manipulating objects

Object properties, methods, and nested objects

Using shorthand syntax and modern object features

Understanding the relationship between classes and objects


🔹 3. Recap: Hoisting & Functions
